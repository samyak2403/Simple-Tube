# Building

For most users, we recommend importing and building through Android Studio.

## Build variants

There are the following build variants

```
universal (all architectures)
arm64 (arm64-v8a)
uncommonabi (armeabi-v7a, x86, x86_64)
x86_64
```

**For most users, the `universal` variant is sufficient.** The other build variants may reduce file size, however at the
cost of compatibility.

# Contributing to OuterTune

## Submitting a pull request
To make everyone's life easier, there are a set of guidelines that are to be followed when submitting pull requests.

- One pull request for one feature/issue, please refrain from tackling many features/issues in one pull request
- Write a descriptive title and a meaningful description
- Upload images/video for any UI changes
- In the event of merge conflicts, you may be required to rebase onto the current `dev` branch
- **You are required to build and test the app before submitting a pull request**

## Commiting guidelines
- Prefix commits with tags, and provide descriptions if necessary. These are generally done in format:
  `tag: commit_name`. [Example](https://github.com/DD3Boh/OuterTune/commit/798e8366227dd2cc38355224c733dbf7e8ffcee0)
    - A list of tags commonly used is provided below
- Commit descriptions are not required, but highly recommended
- When porting/cherry-picking/stealing from other repositories or sources:
    - Maintain
      authorship. [Example](https://github.com/DD3Boh/OuterTune/commit/b0dc59682190b41f0200e9df5174322acaa3d40d)
    - If this is not possible please provide the source in the commit
      description. [Example](https://github.com/DD3Boh/OuterTune/pull/59/commits/e40325dd86ac2c30347cfd4f9e92bbf15a0d0c82)
- Do not merge `dev` into your branch
    - Instead, please rebase over dev
- Merge conflicts
    - As per the previous point, please rebase and conflicts are to be resolve in the commits themselves
    - We may ask you to rebase your PR if merge conflicts are an issue when merging
- If database schema changes are required, please state clearly if a version increment is required. Additional details
  are in the `Database schema changes` section
- For multi-part commits where all parts are required for functionality, use
  `[1/2], [2/2], etc`. [See example](https://github.com/DD3Boh/OuterTune/pull/59/commits)
